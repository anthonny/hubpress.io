<p>This morning, I was expecting to write a sad,"Thanks for supporting us, but I guess the world isn&#8217;t ready" kind of note tonight.I am AMAZED and humbled to tell you that, after a really incredible last day, we have HIT OUR GOAL!  Runcible will be a thing.  You have said yes, and we are doing it.  I couldn&#8217;t be more happy or proud.</p>

<p>So many things happened tonight.  I want to tell you about two in particular: one is that we were able to raise over sixty thousand dollars in under twelve hours.  The other is that we had some periods today when PayPal payments were failing.  I yelled and lost some hair.  But then IndieGoGo allowed us to add 24 hours to the campaign deadline to account for the lost transactions.  As it turned out, we didn&#8217;t even need it.</p>

<p>Thank you all so very much for supporting this project and allowing us to make it a reality.  This is going to be an intense and exciting few months.  We can&#8217;t wait to get going!</p>
