:hp-tags: Get Noticed, Daj się poznać

Recently I've begun my journey in the 'Get Noticed' contest. Accordingly to my https://trello.com/b/wZ5ZrdZO[Trello board] which I described in the 
http://zbic.in/2017/03/02/Go-home-JS-Setting-up-Trello-board-to-keep-things-organized.html[previous blog post] I started creating an MVP. In this early stage I have to get a basic quiz flow, which implies implementing a service that handles the logic of the game (serving questions, acknowledging answers, etc.). For this purpose, I've created a `GameService` service.

TL;DR:

Since the http://reactivex.io/rxjs/[RxJS] became a standard in Angular 2 development, I thought it would be good to get more proficient in it. A service that handles game logic and exposes several properties that may change (the game status, score, current question) seemed to be a perfect training spot.

If you want to see how it turned out, you can look up the file at GitHub. I am quite happy with the result, especially that it was my first attempt to use something more than only `subscribe` and `map` ;). 

I can totally reccomend this https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754[Introduction to reactive programming you've been missing], if you want to get to know this concept and jump on its hype train.
