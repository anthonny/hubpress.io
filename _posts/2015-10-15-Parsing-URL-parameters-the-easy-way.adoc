= Parsing URL parameters - the easy way
:hp-tags: JavaScript, Gist

I can't believe that I couldn't find a jQuery plugin or a vanilla-JS snippet that would parse the URL parameters infallibly. All of the solutions I stumbled upon were inconvenient to use or, probably surprisingly for their authors, failed when a parameter's value contained the equal sign.

It felt like a right time to save the world myself, therefore I came up with the following code:

++++
<script src="https://gist.github.com/zbicin/72aa8fc4c3e97f7321bc.js"></script>
++++

The snippet transforms this:
----
http://example.com/lorem?foo=bar&foo2=baz&foo3=
----
into this (mind the missing `foo3` parameter):
[source,javascript]
----
{`
  foo: "bar",
  foo2: "baz"
}
----

The code has been tested on major browsers and seems to work flawlessly. However if anything goes wrong (naah, it won't happen), https://twitter.com/zbicin[let me know about it].
