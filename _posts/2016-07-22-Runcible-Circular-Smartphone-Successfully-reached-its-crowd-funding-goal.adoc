*From his words:*

> This morning, I was expecting to write a sad,"Thanks for supporting us, but I guess the world isn't ready" kind of note tonight.I am AMAZED and humbled to tell you that, after a really incredible last day, we have HIT OUR GOAL!  Runcible will be a thing.  You have said yes, and we are doing it.  I couldn't be more happy or proud.

> So many things happened tonight.  I want to tell you about two in particular: one is that we were able to raise over sixty thousand dollars in under twelve hours.  The other is that we had some periods today when PayPal payments were failing.  I yelled and lost some hair.  But then IndieGoGo allowed us to add 24 hours to the campaign deadline to account for the lost transactions.  As it turned out, we didn't even need it.

> Thank you all so very much for supporting this project and allowing us to make it a reality.  This is going to be an intense and exciting few months.  We can't wait to get going!

So, We may see runcibles in many people's hand soon...
