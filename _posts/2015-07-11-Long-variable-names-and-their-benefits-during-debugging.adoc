= Long variable names and their benefits during debugging
:hp-tags: Any language

Generally I tend to make jokes on Java and their long class, methods and variable names. The fact that there is a question on StackOverflow asking http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2230871/when-is-a-java-method-name-too-long[when a Java method name is too long] makes it even more ridiculous for me.

However, after reading the http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0132350882/helion-20[Clean Code by Robert C. Martin] my opinion on long names become more liberate. To the extent that now I promote using longer, descriptive names if their usage makes sense. They may come in handy while dubugging as well, which is the clue of this blog post.
