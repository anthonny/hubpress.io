= JIRA Tempo Timesheet Notifier
:hp-tags: JIRA, UserScript

I've made a UserScript that periodically displays currently tracked issue in JIRA Tempo Timesheets using HTML5 Notification API. It was a functionality that I really missed in Tempo Timesheets, so after tracking another couple of minutes to a wrong issue I decided to implement it myself. 

The idea is trivial: the script sets an interval, which every 10 minutes searches the DOM for the issue's summary and shows a new notification.
