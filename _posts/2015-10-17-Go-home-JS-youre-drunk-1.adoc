What would be the result of the following code:
[source,javascript]
----
var myArray = undefined; // intended to be an array, but happened to be undefined e.g. due to a missing function parameter
var isCondition = myArray && myArray.length > 0;
console.log(isCondition);
----
?

Boolean false? Apparently not. The `isCondition` would be equal to... `undefined`. What implications does it have? 

If we used the `isCondition` variable in code later on in an `if` statement like this:

[source,javascript]
----
if(isCondition) { /* ... */ }
----

the `isCondition` would eventually evaluate to `false` and everything's gonna work as expected. However, if we compared `isCondition` to `false`:

[source,javascript]
----
if(isCondition == false) { /* ... */ }
// or even better
if(isCondition === false) { /* ... */ }
----

the code inside the brackets would not be launched. The same principle applies in case of `myArray` being equal to `null` by any chance.
