= OOP in AngularJS #1 - defining a class
:hp-tags: AngularJS, JavaScript


When it comes to object oriented programming, JavaScript is a little bit weird in comparison with other (preferably C-like) languages. The same holds true while working with AngularJS.

The topic has been already covered in the Internet multiple times. If you're looking for a comprehensive article, google it up. This blog post is intended to be used more like a handnote or a cheatsheet, so I'll try to keep it extremally concise.

Defining a class in plain JavaScript:

[source,javascript]
----
var test = 'a';
----

In order to use it in an Angular's controller, the code above has to be wrapped into a factory:
[source,javascript]
----
var test = 'a';
----

and injected as any other module:
[source,javascript]
----
myApp.controller('MainController', ['$scope', 'Task', function ($scope, Task) {
  $scope.task = new Task('Lorem lipsum #hashtag');
}]);
----
