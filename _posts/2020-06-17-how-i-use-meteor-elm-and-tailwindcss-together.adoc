:toc: macro

I have worked with {url-elm}[Elm] last year and honestly it was an great experience.
I really liked it and I would like to use {url-elm}[Elm] in all my new projects.
But I also like {url-meteor}[Meteor] and three weeks ago I started using it again.
I discovered {url-meteor}[Meteor] in 2015, I gave a talk about it (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxIvfQXTqVo) and it still feels like "Wow!" when you start a project.
So in this post I will explain how I make the two work together and how to add {url-tailwindcss}[Tailwindcss] for the UI part (I love {url-tailwindcss}[Tailwindcss] too 😍), from scratch.
I will also explain how to link an existing project to {url-meteor}[Meteor] with a Todo app.

== Prerequisite

You only need two things:

- Your favourite IDE (VSCode with the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Elmtooling.elm-ls-vscode[Elm extension] fits very well)
- A browser

You don't need to install NPM, Node or Mongo.
All this stuff is already packaged in {url-meteor}[Meteor] environment.

So to run a NPM command we will use `meteor npm xxx`, and for Mongo, we will use `meteor mongo`.

So let's begin 😁

== Meteor

=== Install Meteor

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2006548/84738510-53981b80-afaa-11ea-8d02-cdf6c42c26c0.png[]

Here are the commands to install {url-meteor}[Meteor] on OSX/Linux and Windows
OSX / Linux

```shell
# OSX/Linux
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh

# Windows
choco install meteor
```

NOTE: For more information about the installation, please refer to the official documentation here https://www.meteor.com/install

=== Create a project

Let's start by creating an empty project

```shell
meteor create meteor-elm-app --bare
cd meteor-elm-app
```

This `--bare` option will create an empty project with static-html instead of blaze and without autopublish and insecure.

NOTE: For more information about the command create, follow the link to the https://docs.meteor.com/commandline.html#meteorcreate[documentation]


=== Add typescript

Adding Typescript is really simple.
Just run these two commands

```shell
# under meteor-elm-app
meteor add typescript
meteor npm i -D @types/meteor @types/mocha
```

Create a tsconfig.json under the directory *meteor-elm-app*
```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
      /* Basic Options */
      "target": "es2018",
      "module": "esNext",
      "lib": ["esnext", "dom"],
      "allowJs": true,
      "checkJs": false,
      "incremental": false,
      "noEmit": true,
  
      /* Strict Type-Checking Options */
      "strict": true,
      "noImplicitAny": true,
      "strictNullChecks": true,
  
      /* Additional Checks */
      "noUnusedLocals": true,
      "noUnusedParameters": true,
      "noImplicitReturns": false,
      "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": false,
  
      /* Module Resolution Options */
      "baseUrl": ".",
      "paths": {
        /* Support absolute ~imports/* with a leading '/' */
        "/*": ["*"]
      },
      "moduleResolution": "node",
      "resolveJsonModule": true,
      "types": ["node", "mocha"],
      "esModuleInterop": true,
      "preserveSymlinks": true,
    },
    "exclude": [
      "./.meteor/**",
      "./packages/**"
    ]
  }
```

NOTE: This configuration comes from the typescript template provided by {url-meteor}[Meteor].
I just removed the support of JSX.

=== Create the file structure

NOTE: We will setup a simple file structure here.
For more complex projects, you should follow the https://guide.meteor.com/structure.html#javascript-structure[guideline] provided by {url-meteor}[Meteor]

To initialise the file structure, run these commands
```shell
# under meteor-elm-app
mkdir client server imports/api
touch client/main.html client/main.ts client/main.css server/main.ts
```

Your project folder should look like this:

```shell
# under meteor-elm-app
❯ tree -I node_modules                                              
.
├── client
│   ├── main.css
│   ├── main.html
│   └── main.ts
├── imports
│   └── api
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── server
│   └── main.ts
└── tsconfig.json

4 directories, 7 files
```

We will update the *package.json* file to define the main modules in our {url-meteor}[Meteor] app:

```json
"meteor": {
    "mainModule": {
        "client": "client/main.ts",
        "server": "server/main.ts"
    }
}
```

At this point your *package.json* file should be like:
```json
{
  "name": "meteor-elm-app",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "meteor run"
  },
  "meteor": {
    "mainModule": {
      "client": "client/main.ts",
      "server": "server/main.ts"
    }
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@babel/runtime": "^7.8.3",
    "meteor-node-stubs": "^1.0.0"
  }
}

```

NOTE: if you need more informations about this mainModule options, you can read the content of https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/9690[this pull request]

We now need to add some basic content to the *main.html* file:

```html
<head>
  <title>meteor-elm-app</title>
</head>

<body>
  <div id="main">Elm app will be here</div>
</body>
```

=== Checkpoint

Lets check if everything is OK before starting with {url-elm}[Elm].
Start your *meteor* server: 
```shell
# under meteor-elm-app
meteor
```

Open http://localhost:3000 on your favorite browser
You should see this:

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2006548/84446744-8195fc80-ac46-11ea-9da8-4fd2033898bf.png[]


== Elm

=== Install Parcel

We will use {url-parcel}[Parcel] to build our {url-elm}[Elm] application and we will use the result of this build in our {url-meteor}[Meteor] application

To install {url-parcel}[Parcel], run this command

```shell
meteor npm i -D parcel
```

=== Create a Meteor package

This {url-meteor}[Meteor] package will contain our {url-elm}[Elm] application and we will use this package inside the {url-meteor}[Meteor] application.

We use a Package because it allows us to isolate our {url-elm}[Elm] application from the rest of the {url-meteor}[Meteor] context.
It is also really useful if we want to remove our {url-elm}[Elm] application or if one we don't want to use {url-meteor}[Meteor] anymore.

Let's start by creating some folders:
```shell
mkdir -p packages/elm-app/{app,dist}
```

The *app* folder will contain the sources of our {url-elm}[Elm] application ({url-elm}[Elm], TS and CSS files).
The *dist* folder will contain the result of the build made by {url-parcel}[Parcel].

Because we will build with {url-parcel}[Parcel] and not with {url-meteor}[Meteor], we will create a new file at the root of the *meteor-elm-app* called *.meteorignore*

```shell
#under meteor-elm-app
touch .meteorignore
```

Then add this line inside this new file:
```shell
/packages/elm-app/app/**/*
```

Because we don't want to push the *dist* and the *elm-stuff* folders on our repository, we will add them in the *.gitignore* located under the folder *meteor-elm-app*

```shell
dist
elm-stuff
```

Now, let's create a *package.js* file in our package:

```shell
#under meteor-elm-app/packages/elm-app
touch package.js
```

And add the following content in this file:
```js
Package.describe({
    name: 'elm-app',
    version: '1.0.0',
    summary: 'elm app',
    documentation: 'add your elm app into meteor',
});

Package.onUse(function (api) {
    api.versionsFrom('1.10.2');
    api.use('modules');
    api.addFiles('dist/elm-app.css', 'client');
    api.mainModule('dist/elm-app.js', 'client');
});
```

*Package.describe* says that our package:

- is called `elm-app`,
- is in version `1.0.0`

`Package.onUse` says that our package:

- is implemented to be use with {url-meteor}[Meteor] `1.10.2`, 
- uses the `modules` package, so we will be able to use `import {} from ''`,
- will add the `dist/elm-app.css` file in the client when it will be loaded,
- have a main js file for this package called `dist/elm-app.js`.

If you are using *elm-css* and if you don't need specific css classes in your app, you can remove `api.addFiles('dist/elm-app.css', 'client');` from the *package.js* file.

NOTE: For more informations about the Package.js file, see the https://docs.meteor.com/api/packagejs.html[documentation]

=== Create the app

We will create our {url-elm}[Elm] application under the folder *packages/elm-app/app*.

We need to install {url-elm}[Elm]:

```shell
meteor npm i -D elm elm-format
```

NOTE: elm-format is not mandatory but you should use it with your IDE to format on save and to avoid problem at compile time

Then we will initialise our app with the following command:

```shell
#under meteor-elm-app/packages/elm-app/app
meteor npx elm init
```

Validate the creation of the *elm.json* file and we are good 👍.

At this step, your folder should be like this:

```shell
#under meteor-elm-app
❯ tree -I 'node_modules|.meteor' -a
.
├── .gitignore
├── .meteorignore
├── client
│   ├── main.css
│   ├── main.html
│   └── main.ts
├── imports
│   └── api
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── packages
│   └── elm-app
│       ├── app
│       │   ├── elm.json
│       │   └── src
│       ├── dist
│       └── package.js
├── server
│   └── main.ts
└── tsconfig.json

9 directories, 11 files
```

In a first time, we will create a simple {url-elm}[Elm] application.

Create a *Main.elm* file inside the folder *packages/elm-app/app/src* with this content:

```elm
module Main exposing(main)

import Browser
import Html exposing (Html, text)

type alias Model = String

main : Program () Model msg
main =
    Browser.element
        { init = init
        , view = view
        , update = update
        , subscriptions = subscriptions
        }

init: () -> (Model, Cmd msg)
init _ =
    ("Hello from Elm app", Cmd.none)

view: Model -> Html msg
view model =
    text model

update: msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd msg)
update _ model =
    (model, Cmd.none)

subscriptions : Model -> Sub msg
subscriptions _ =
    Sub.none
```

=== The CSS main file

In the folder *meteor-elm-app/packages/elm-app/app*, create an empty *main.scss* SCSS file (or CSS if you prefer) that we will use later to add some style in our {url-elm}[Elm] application.

NB: if you use *elm-css* and you don't need a stylesheet, skip this step and remove the line `api.addFiles('dist/elm-app.css', 'client');` in the *package.js* file

=== The Package mainModule

In the folder *meteor-elm-app/packages/elm-app/app*, create a file *index.ts* that will *mount* our {url-elm}[Elm] application and export the *ports*.

A simple version could be:

```js
import './main.scss'
const { Elm } = require('./src/Main.elm')

export const init = (configuration: any) => {
    const app = Elm.Main.init(configuration)
    return app.ports
}
```

But because we want to *Type* things as much as possible, let's create this *index.ts* like this:

```js
import './main.scss'
const { Elm } = require('./src/Main.elm')

interface Flags {}

export interface Configuration {
    node: HTMLElement | null,
    flags: Flags
}

export interface Ports {}

export const init: (configuration: Configuration) => Ports = (configuration) => {
    const app = Elm.Main.init(configuration)
    return app.ports
}
```

With this definition, when we will need some flags or some ports, we will add the new stuff in our interface and the client will have to implement them.

NOTE: If you are using *CSS* instead of *SCSS* then update the file import accordingly

=== Build with Parcel

Let's create a build script in our *package.json* file:
```json
"elm:build": "parcel build packages/elm-app/app/index.ts -d packages/elm-app/dist --out-file elm-app.js --no-cache",
```

This script will build our application in a file *elm-app.js* (and *elm-app.css*) and put it in the folder *packages/elm-app/dist* (the one we added in our *.gitignore*) 


We can test our script

```shell
#under meteor-elm-app
meteor npm run elm:build
```

If everything is ok, you should see these lines:

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2006548/84450020-4ea43680-ac4f-11ea-9b45-ce0dfb572835.png[]


=== Add our package to Meteor 

Now that we have a package, we have to add it in our {url-meteor}[Meteor] configuration.

NOTE: you must have run the previous build command before adding the package because without a dist folder, you will not be able to add it.

Execute this command to add the package

```shell
#under meteor-elm-app
meteor add elm-app
```

You should see

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2006548/84450082-7abfb780-ac4f-11ea-92f4-db936ee6f726.png[]


=== Post install

To avoid to have to compile manually each time someone clone the repository, we will add a `postinstall` script in the *package.json* file:

```json
"postinstall": "meteor npm run elm:build",
```

== Use the Elm application in our Meteor client

Now that we have our {url-elm}[Elm] application, it is time to import it in the client side of our {url-meteor}[Meteor] application

In the *client/main.ts* file, add the following code:

```js
import { init } from "meteor/elm-app";
import { Meteor } from 'meteor/meteor';

Meteor.startup(() => {
    const ports = init({
        node: document.getElementById("main"),
        flags: {}
    })
})
```

In this code, we import the `init` function from the package `meteor/elm-app` which is the package we have just created (you can see it in the file *.meteor/packages*).
Then we call it to mount our {url-elm}[Elm] application on the node `document.getElementById("main")` (the one we have created in the *main.html* file)

Now, if you start your meteor application by running the `meteor` command, on http://localhost:3000 you should see:

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2006548/84450699-4a791880-ac51-11ea-9c51-c0046cc273a0.png[]

But...

=== The typing is not good

You should see that your import is underlined in red:

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2006548/84450825-9c21a300-ac51-11ea-9243-78a13ecad82d.png[]

To fix that, we will add a declaration file:

```shell 
#under meteor-elm-app
mkdir -p types/meteor
touch types/meteor/elm-app.d.ts
```

And add the following content

```js
declare module 'meteor/elm-app' {
    export const init: (
        configuration: import('/packages/elm-app/app').Configuration,
    ) => import('/packages/elm-app/app').Ports;
}
```

Now each time we will change the definition of the type `Flag` or the type `Port` inside our {url-elm}[Elm] application, we will be sure to know if we have some stuff to fix in the {url-meteor}[Meteor] client 💪.

== Live Reload

Because we don't want to build manually our {url-elm}[Elm] application each time we make a change, we will setup the live reload

We will install some packages to help us
```shell
#under meteor-elm-app
meteor npm i -D concurrently wait-on rimraf
```

Then we will create an new script in our *package.json* file:

```json
"elm:watch": "parcel watch packages/elm-app/app/index.ts -d packages/elm-app/dist --out-file elm-app.js",
```

With `elm:watch`, parcel will rebuild our app each time we make a change in {url-elm}[Elm], TS or SCSS files under the folder *packages/elm-app/app*.

And because `parcel watch` create a *.cache* folder, we will add it to the *.gitignore* file.
The content of your *.gitignore* should be like this:

```shell
node_modules/
dist
elm-stuff
.cache
```

Now to run parcel and meteor in parallel, we will update the *package.json* file.
We will rename the script `start` to `meteor:run`, and redefine the script `start`:

```json
"meteor:run": "meteor run",
"start": "rimraf \"./packages/elm-app/dist/*\" && concurrently -n \"parcel,meteor\" -c \"magenta,green\" \"meteor npm run elm:watch\" \"wait-on ./packages/elm-app/dist/elm-app.js && meteor npm run meteor:run\"",
```

The script `start` call `rimraf` to clean the *dist* folder, then we call `concurrently` to run two tasks:

- the `parcel` one, that will be log in `magenta` and its command is `meteor npm run elm:watch`
- the `meteor` one, that will be log in `green` and its command is `wait-on ./packages/elm-app/dist/elm-app.js && meteor npm run meteor:run` (the `wait-on` command is use to wait the build from Parcel)

Now each time we will change our content under *packages/elm-app/app*, {url-parcel}[Parcel] will rebuild incrementally our application and update the content under the *dist* folder, so {url-meteor}[Meteor] will detect a change and refresh the main application.

You can now start your application by running:
```shell
#under meteor-elm-app
meteor npm start
```

You can make some changes in your `Main.elm` file and see that everything will automatically refresh in your browser.

== Tailwindcss

Tailwindcss is a npm package, so we will install it like this

```shell
meteor npm i -D tailwindcss
```

NOTE: For more informations about Tailwindcss, see the https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation[documentation]

We need to initialize Tailwincss:

```shell
#under meteor-elm-app/packages/elm-app/app
meteor npx tailwindcss init
```

This command will generate a file called *tailwind.config.js*


We can now edit the file *main.scss* inside our app (packages/elm-app/app/main.scss) to use {url-tailwindcss}[Tailwindcss]

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```


We will configure *postcss* to use *autoprefixer* and the *tailwind.config.js* file.

```shell
#under meteor-elm-app/packages/elm-app/app
touch postcss.config.js
```

And add this content to this file
```js
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require("tailwindcss")(path.join(__dirname, "tailwind.config.js")),
    require("autoprefixer"),
  ],
};
```

We can now edit our *Main.elm* to add a CSS class (`text-green-500`) from Tailwindcss:

```elm
view: Model -> Html msg
view model =
    div [class "text-green-500"] [text model]
```

Then if you (re)start your server, you should see this:

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2006548/84566211-bfdb0b00-ad6f-11ea-86fa-927a901ae327.png[]

Congratulations 🎉! You made your first application with {url-elm}[Elm], {url-meteor}[Meteor] and Tailwindcss 👏.

== The Todos application

It is really awesome right? What? You don't want to use {url-meteor}[Meteor] just to expose static file? Hmm ok, let's go with the Todos application

Because the goal of this post is not to learn how to code in {url-elm}[Elm], we will start with an application I wrote for the occasion.

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2006548/84833215-132eb100-b02f-11ea-836b-63a14a6dbe74.png[]

This application is not linked with {url-meteor}[Meteor] yet, there is no ports defined.
The goal is to save each Todo in MongoDB and to be able to sync two browser.

=== Update the Main.elm

Replace the content of the Main.elm file with https://gist.github.com/anthonny/1b6a73782a6ad94c611849b9a5d4cbbf[this gist]

We will need to add `elm/svg`:
```shell
#under meteor-elm-app/packages/elm-app/app
meteor npx elm install elm/svg
```

Then start your application
```shell
meteor npm start
```

You can try the application, actually we can:

- Add a Todo
- Switch the status of a Todo
- Filter Todos by status

We will keep the filtering part in the client, but we want to:

- Load Todos from MongoDB
- Save new Todos in MongoDB
- Switch the status and save it in MongoDB

But let's start with the backend

=== Define the Todos collection and methods

Under the folder *meteor-elm-app/imports/api*, create a file *todos.ts*.

In this file we will define what is a Todo, and create the collection:
```js
import { Mongo } from "meteor/mongo";
import { Meteor } from "meteor/meteor";

export interface Todo {
  _id?: string;
  value: string;
  status: "checked" | "unchecked";
  createdAt: Date;
}

export const TodosCollection = new Mongo.Collection<Todo>("todos");
```

Then in the same file, we will add two {url-meteor}[Meteor] methods, one to add a Todo and another to switch the status of Todo with its ID:

```js
Meteor.methods({
  "todos.addTodo"(value: string) {
    if (value !== "") {
      TodosCollection.insert({
        value,
        status: "unchecked",
        createdAt: new Date(),
      });
    }
  },
  "todos.toggleStatus"(todoId: string) {
    const todo = TodosCollection.findOne({ _id: todoId });
    if (!todo) {
      throw new Meteor.Error("Todo not found");
    }
    
    const newStatus = todo.status === "checked" ? "unchecked" : "checked";

    TodosCollection.update({ _id: todoId }, { $set: { status: newStatus } });
  },
});
```

And at the end of the file, we will publish our collection on the server side:
```js
if (Meteor.isServer) {
  Meteor.publish("todos", function todos() {
    return TodosCollection.find({}, { sort: { createdAt: -1 } });
  });
}
``` 

Finally we need to import this file in the file *server/main.ts*:

```js
import "/imports/api/todos";
```

The server side in now ready.

=== Add ports to the Elm application

We will start by installing `elm/json` and `NoRedInk/elm-json-decode-pipeline` to decode our Todos:

```shell
#under meteor-elm-app/packages/elm-app/app
meteor npx elm install elm/json
meteor npx elm install NoRedInk/elm-json-decode-pipeline
```

So we will create 3 ports:

- addTodo: `port addTodo : String -> Cmd msg`
- toggleStatus: `port toggleStatus : String -> Cmd msg`
- receiveTodos: `port receiveTodos : (Decode.Value -> msg) -> Sub msg`

Let's put these port at the end of our *Main.elm* file:

```elm
port module Main exposing(main)

import Json.Decode as Decode
import Json.Decode.Pipeline exposing (required)

...

port addTodo : String -> Cmd msg

port toggleStatus : String -> Cmd msg

port receiveTodos : (Decode.Value -> msg) -> Sub msg

```

We have to change the type of the Todo.id to use a `String` because of the id in Mongo:

```elm
type alias Todo =
    { id : String
    , value : String
    , status : TodoStatus
    }

type Msg
    = InputChanged String
    | AddTodo
    | ToggleStatus String -- ToggleStatus now need a String not a Int
    | FilterBy Filter

```

We need a new variant `ReceiveTodos (List Todo)` for `Msg` to receive todos:

```elm
type Msg
    = InputChanged String
    | AddTodo
    | ToggleStatus String
    | FilterBy Filter
    | ReceiveTodos (List Todo)
```

We also change the `update` function because we will not update the `todos` list anymore.
We will get the one we will receive from the port `receiveTodos`

```elm
update : Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
update msg model =
    case msg of
        InputChanged value ->
            ( { model | todo = value }, Cmd.none )

        AddTodo ->
            if String.isEmpty (String.trim model.todo) then
                ( model, Cmd.none )

            else
                ( { model | todo = "" }, addTodo model.todo )

        ToggleStatus todoId ->
            ( model, toggleStatus todoId )

        FilterBy selectedFilter ->
            ( { model | filter = selectedFilter }, Cmd.none )

        ReceiveTodos todos ->
            ( { model | todos = todos }, Cmd.none )
```

To finish with the {url-elm}[Elm] part, we need a subscription and some decoders to receive our Todos:

```elm

If you remember, we have defined an interface `Ports` in the file *meteor-elm-app/packages/elm-app/app/index.ts*.
It is time to add some definitions:

```js
interface Todo {
  id: string;
  value: string;
  status: "checked" | "unchecked";
}

export interface Ports {
  addTodo?: {
    subscribe: (fn: (todo: string) => void) => void;
  };
  toggleStatus?: {
    subscribe: (fn: (todoId: string) => void) => void;
  };
  receiveTodos?: {
    send: (todos: Todo[]) => void;
  };
}
```

=== Link ports to Meteor.methods and subscriptions

We have some piece of code in {url-elm}[Elm] and some piece of code in the server side.
Now we need to link them together, and we will do that in the file *client/main.ts*

We will need to import our TodosCollection and the {url-meteor}[Meteor] Tracker
```js
import { Tracker } from "meteor/tracker";
import { TodosCollection } from "/imports/api/todos";
```

Then we will subscribe to the output ports:
```js
  ports.addTodo?.subscribe((todo) => {
    Meteor.call("todos.addTodo", todo, (err: Error) => {
      if (err) {
        // Maybe we should pass this error to Elm
        console.log("error", err);
        return;
      }
    });
  });

  ports.toggleStatus?.subscribe((todoId) => {
    Meteor.call("todos.toggleStatus", todoId, (err: Error) => {
      if (err) {
        // Maybe we should pass this error to Elm
        console.log("error", err);
        return;
      }
    });
  });
```

Here each time `addTodo` is called from {url-elm}[Elm], we add a new Todo with a Meteor.call, same for the toggleStatus.

NOTE: Of course we should manage the error, maybe it could be a good exercice 😁

Finally we need to send todos everytime the collection change.
To do that, we use `Tracker.autorun` that will run the callback when necessary.

```js
  // We use the Tracker.autorun to send todos each time the fetch result
  // changes
  Tracker.autorun(() => {
    // Maybe one day we will need to manage the subscription
    const subscription = Meteor.subscribe("todos");

    const todos = TodosCollection.find({}, { sort: { createdAt: 1 } }).fetch();

    ports.receiveTodos?.send(
      todos.map((todo) => ({
        id: todo._id || "",
        value: todo.value,
        status: todo.status,
      }))
    );
  });
```

Now you can restart your server, open two browsers on http://localhost:3000 and see that everything is saved and sync 👏.

== Conclusion

I hope you enjoyed this content as much as I enjoyed writing it.
Three weeks ago I was sad because I could not use {url-meteor}[Meteor] with {url-elm}[Elm], so I started using it with React and Typescript 😳.

Today, I dropped React and I use {url-elm}[Elm] again and it is really pleasant.
